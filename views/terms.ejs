    <h2>DMCA Takedown Policy</h2>
  
    <p>
      Mossbook respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same.
      In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
      we will respond to properly submitted copyright infringement notices and
      take appropriate actions, which may include removing or disabling access
      to the allegedly infringing material and/or terminating user accounts in appropriate circumstances.
    </p>
  
    <h3>How to Submit a DMCA Takedown Notice</h3>
  
    <p>
      If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied
      or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,
      please provide a written notification (email is acceptable) that includes the following:
    </p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Your full legal name and electronic or physical signature.</li>
      <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or a representative list of such works if multiple are involved).</li>
      <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and needs to be removed, including a direct URL or other detailed description of where it is located on the site.</li>
      <li>Your contact information, including a mailing address, telephone number, and a valid email address.</li>
      <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
      <li>A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>
      Please send your complete notice to:
      <a href="mailto:legal@mossbook.site">legal@mossbook.site</a>
    </p>
  
    <h3>Counter-Notice Process</h3>
  
    <p>
      If you believe that content you posted on Mossbook was removed in error or misidentification,
      you may submit a written counter-notification that must include:
    </p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Your full legal name, address, telephone number, and electronic or physical signature.</li>
      <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location where the material appeared before it was removed.</li>
      <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed as a result of mistake or misidentification.</li>
      <li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or if outside the U.S., that you consent to jurisdiction in any district in which Mossbook may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who submitted the takedown notice or their agent.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>
      Please send your counter-notice to the same address:
      <a href="mailto:legal@mossbook.site">legal@mossbook.site</a>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, we may reinstate the removed content
      unless the original complaining party files a court action against the user within ten (10) business days.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Please note:</strong> Submitting a false or bad-faith notice or counter-notice
      is a serious legal offense and may result in legal liability.
      Mossbook reserves the right to take action against such abuse.
